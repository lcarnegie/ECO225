Course Notebooks and Projects for ECO225: Big Data Tools for Economists

This course is a practical course focusing on the tools Economists and Data Scientists
use to read, analyze, interpret and present data, from dataset to barchart. We learn
things like the pandas library, regression analysis (with Machine Learning!), along with 
GIS and spatial analysis along with other technologies commonly used in new research.
